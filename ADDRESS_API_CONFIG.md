# Address Autocomplete Configuration

The address autocomplete feature currently uses **OpenStreetMap Nominatim API** (free, no setup required).

## Current Setup: OpenStreetMap Nominatim ✅
- ✅ **Free** - No API key or billing required
- ✅ **Works immediately** - No setup needed
- ✅ **Good coverage** - Worldwide address data
- ⚠️ **Rate limited** - 1 request per second
- ⚠️ **Less precise** - May not find very new addresses

## Upgrade Option: Google Places API 🚀

For higher accuracy and better performance, you can upgrade to Google Places API:

### Setup Steps:
1. **Get Google API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a project or select existing one
   - Enable "Places API"
   - Create API key
   - Restrict key to your domain (security)

2. **Add Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Update Code:**
   - In `src/components/ui/AddressAutocomplete.tsx`
   - Uncomment the Google Places API code section
   - Comment out the Nominatim code section

### Benefits of Google Places API:
- ✅ **Higher accuracy** - More precise address matching
- ✅ **Faster responses** - Better performance
- ✅ **New addresses** - Includes very recent addresses
- ✅ **Business locations** - Finds commercial addresses better
- ❌ **Costs money** - Pay per request after free tier
- ❌ **Requires setup** - Need API key and billing

### Cost:
- **Free tier:** 2,500 requests/day
- **Paid:** $17 per 1,000 requests after free tier

## Current Implementation Works Great!
The current OpenStreetMap implementation is perfectly suitable for most property management needs. Only upgrade if you need higher precision or handle high volumes.

# Edit/Update Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of edit/update functionality for the data management page, allowing users to edit buildings, rooms, tenants, and operators through modal dialogs.

## Components Created

### 1. Dialog Component (`/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`)
- Base modal component using Framer Motion for animations
- Provides Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogDescription, and DialogFooter components
- Features smooth animations and backdrop blur

### 2. Edit Modal Components (`/src/components/admin/`)
- **EditBuildingModal**: Modal for editing building information
- **EditRoomModal**: Modal for editing room details
- **EditTenantModal**: Modal for editing tenant information
- **EditOperatorModal**: Modal for editing operator data

Each modal:
- Reuses existing form components (BuildingForm, RoomForm, TenantForm, OperatorForm)
- Pre-fills form fields with existing data
- Handles form submission with loading states
- Shows success messages after successful updates
- Automatically refreshes the data table

### 3. Tooltip Component (`/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`)
- Provides hover tooltips for action buttons
- Supports multiple positioning options (top, bottom, left, right)
- Includes smooth animations

## Integration with Data Management Page

### Changes Made:
1. Added import statements for modal components
2. Created state variables for tracking which item is being edited
3. Updated Edit buttons to open respective modals
4. Added tooltips to action buttons for better UX
5. Integrated all modals at the bottom of the page component

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Modal dialogs for each entity type
- ✅ Pre-filled forms with existing data
- ✅ Form validation before save
- ✅ Loading states during save operations
- ✅ Success messages after updates
- ✅ Automatic data refresh after successful update
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Cancel functionality
- ✅ Tooltips on action buttons
- ✅ Hover effects for better interaction feedback

## Usage

### Opening Edit Modals:
1. Navigate to the Data Management page
2. Click the Edit button (pencil icon) on any row
3. The modal will open with pre-filled data
4. Make necessary changes
5. Click Save to update or Cancel to close without saving

### Test Page:
A test page is available at `/test-edit-modals` to verify all modals work correctly with sample data.

## Technical Details

### Modal State Management:
```typescript
const [editingBuilding, setEditingBuilding] = useState<Building | null>(null)
const [editingRoom, setEditingRoom] = useState<Room | null>(null)
const [editingTenant, setEditingTenant] = useState<Tenant | null>(null)
const [editingOperator, setEditingOperator] = useState<Operator | null>(null)
```

### Modal Integration Example:
```typescript
<EditBuildingModal
  building={editingBuilding}
  open={!!editingBuilding}
  onOpenChange={(open) => !open && setEditingBuilding(null)}
  onSuccess={() => {
    fetchData()
    showSuccessMessage('Building Updated', 'The building has been updated successfully.')
  }}
  operators={operators}
/>
```

### Data Type Conversion:
Each modal handles proper data type conversion for numeric fields and JSON parsing for array fields to ensure compatibility with the form components.

## Styling

### CSS Animations:
- Modal slide-up animation on open
- Smooth fade transitions
- Hover effects on buttons
- Loading overlay with backdrop blur

### Responsive Design:
- Modals are responsive and work on all screen sizes
- Maximum height with scroll for long forms
- Mobile-optimized touch targets

## Error Handling

- Form validation errors are displayed inline
- Network errors show user-friendly messages
- Forms remain open on error to allow retry
- Success messages confirm successful updates

## Performance Considerations

- Forms are re-rendered with new keys when modals open to ensure fresh state
- Only the active modal is rendered in the DOM
- Efficient data fetching after updates
- Optimized animations for smooth performance

    <h1>Building Names Display Test</h1>
    <p>Please check the browser console after running a room query to see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔍 Deep inspection of first room - Shows raw backend data</li>
        <li>🏗️ Backend buildings data check - Shows if buildings are sent separately</li>
        <li>🏢 Transforming room - Shows building data for each room</li>
        <li>🏠 RoomCards received rooms - Shows final data structure</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Expected Log Output:</h2>
    <pre>
If backend sends 'building' (singular):
- building_singular: {building_name: "Building Name", ...}
- hasBuildingSingular: true
- buildingSingularName: "Building Name"

If backend sends 'buildings' (plural):
- buildings: {building_name: "Building Name", ...}
- hasBuildings: true
- buildingName: "Building Name"
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Code now supports both formats!</h2>
    <p>The room cards will display building names whether the backend sends 'building' or 'buildings'.</p>

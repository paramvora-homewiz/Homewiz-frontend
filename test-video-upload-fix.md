# Video Upload Error Handling Fix - Test Plan

## Changes Made

### 1. BuildingForm.tsx Video Upload Improvements

**Key Changes:**
- Added `clearVideoValidationErrors()` function to clear video-specific errors
- Added `resetVideoInput()` function to reset file input
- Modified `handleVideoUpload()` to clear errors on new file selection
- Reset file input after both success and error scenarios
- Added clear format information in UI (Max 50MB • MP4, WebM, QuickTime, AVI)

**Error Clearing Logic:**
- Errors are cleared immediately when new files are selected (including cancellation)
- File input is reset after error to allow immediate retry
- File input is reset after successful upload

### 2. Image Upload Improvements

**Key Changes:**
- Added similar error handling for image uploads
- Added `clearImageValidationErrors()` and `resetImageInput()` functions
- Added file size validation (10MB max for images)
- Added format information in UI (Max 10MB • JPEG, PNG, WebP)

### 3. MediaUploadSection.tsx Improvements

**Key Changes:**
- Clear errors immediately when new files are selected
- Reset file input on validation errors
- Already had good error handling and input reset in finally block

## Test Scenarios

### Video Upload Error Handling:

1. **Large Video File Test:**
   - Select a video file > 50MB
   - Verify error message appears with clear size info
   - Try selecting another file immediately
   - Verify no previous errors remain
   - Verify new file can be selected successfully

2. **Invalid File Type Test:**
   - Select a non-video file (e.g., PDF) in video section
   - Verify appropriate error message
   - Try uploading a valid video file
   - Verify successful upload without refresh

3. **Cancel Selection Test:**
   - Start file selection, then cancel
   - Verify no errors appear
   - Verify form remains functional

### Image Upload Error Handling:

1. **Large Image File Test:**
   - Select an image file > 10MB
   - Verify error message with size info
   - Verify immediate retry capability

2. **Multiple Category Test:**
   - Upload invalid file to "Outside Building"
   - Verify error only affects that category
   - Upload to "Common Areas" should work normally

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **BEFORE (Problem):**
- User uploads large video → gets error → form becomes unusable until refresh
- Errors persist when selecting new files
- No clear format guidance

✅ **AFTER (Fixed):**
- User uploads large video → gets clear error → can immediately try different file
- Errors clear automatically when new files are selected
- Clear format information shown in UI
- Form remains fully functional without refresh

## Implementation Details

### Error State Management:
```typescript
// Clear video errors specifically
const clearVideoValidationErrors = () => {
  setFileValidationErrors(prev => 
    prev.filter(err => !err.file.type.startsWith('video/'))
  )
}

// Reset file input to allow retry
const resetVideoInput = (input: HTMLInputElement) => {
  input.value = ''
}
```

### User Experience Improvements:
- Immediate error feedback with clear size limits
- Automatic error clearing on new selection
- File input reset for immediate retry
- Better visual indicators (cursor changes, format info)
- No form refresh required

### Error Prevention:
- Clear format requirements shown in UI
- File size limits clearly communicated
- Immediate validation with helpful messages

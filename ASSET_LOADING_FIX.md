# 🔧 Fix for Next.js Asset Loading 404 Errors

## Problem
You're experiencing 404 errors for Next.js assets like:
- `layout.css`
- `page.css` 
- `main-app.js`
- `webpack.js`
- `app-pages-internals.js`

## Root Cause
These errors occur when the development server has stale cache or corrupted build artifacts that conflict with the current code.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

I've implemented several fixes:

1. **Enhanced Next.js Configuration** - Added aggressive cache-busting
2. **Clean Development Scripts** - Added cache clearing commands
3. **Automated Fix Script** - Created `fix-dev-server.sh` for complete cleanup

## 🚀 How to Fix (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Use the Automated Fix Script (Recommended)
```bash
./fix-dev-server.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Steps
```bash
# Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C if running)
npm run clean
npm run dev:clean
```

### Method 3: Quick Clean Start
```bash
npm run dev:clean
```

## 📋 After Running the Fix

1. **Hard Refresh Your Browser:**
   - **Chrome/Firefox:** `Ctrl+F5` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - **Alternative:** Open DevTools → Right-click refresh → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

2. **Verify the Fix:**
   - ✅ No more 404 errors in browser console
   - ✅ All CSS and JS files load properly
   - ✅ Application functions normally

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| ❌ Assets return 404 errors | ✅ Fresh build with unique IDs |
| ❌ Stale cache conflicts | ✅ Aggressive cache clearing |
| ❌ Development server issues | ✅ Clean restart process |

## 🛠️ Technical Details

The fix includes:
- Unique build IDs to prevent cache conflicts
- Disabled development caching
- Content hashing for unique asset names
- Clean scripts for easy cache clearing

## 🎯 Expected Result

After following these steps, your development server should:
- Load all assets correctly (no 404 errors)
- Display the application properly
- Function without console errors

The asset loading issues should be completely resolved! 🎉
